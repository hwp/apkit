Audio Processing Kit (apkit)
============================

This is a python library for audio processing. It includes the following functions:

* Basic I/O
* Basic Operations
* Cross-correlation and TDOA estimation
* Spatial spectral-based sound source localization
* Beamforming

Dependency
----------

* Numpy
* Scipy

Conventions
-----------

* Arrays are numpy arrays.
* Multi-dimension array indices follow such order (if exist): channel, time, frequency.

Install
-------

```
pip install -e .
```
